# ReBlock for Windows

Welcome to ReBlock. You may know us from our macOS releases. And we have just created a version for Windows.

This has been a long-coming project, a wrench in the works. Over a month of expertise has went into this before Beta 1 for Windows, and this isn't the end. This isn't even the beginning. 

This is ReBlock. and we have so much planned.
