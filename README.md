# ReBlock for Windows
This repository contains all of the files for ReBlock, all contained in one place for people to access if they want to modify it (as long as it follows the license agreement) or use it when the websites are blocked (the lite one shouldn't be since it's a Google Site).

We've also contained all of the files for all of the compiled versions.

We hope you enjoy! <3
